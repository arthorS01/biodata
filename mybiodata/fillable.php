I'm a backeend developer. The goal is to become a fullstack developer.<br> As of now though, i'm taking the beginners at bincom.
It's one of the requiremnts for getting the Internship(hopefully) i applied for.<br>The classes have been rewarding because it brought several things back to mind and also 
gave me a different view on a few things i had not considered before<br>
